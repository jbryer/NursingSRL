## Overview


## Data Preparation

The data for this example come from Nagelsmith, Bryer, and Yan (2012). It measures academic self-reguation, volitional control, and GPA for nursing students in an online college.

```{r}
srl <- read.xls('../Data/NursingSRL.xlsx', sheet=1)
names(srl)
```

## Instruments

Academic Volitional Strategies Inventory (AVSI) - 20 items measuring three factors:

* Stress Reducing Actions
* Negative-Based Incentives
* Self-Efficacy Enhancement

Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) - 31 items measuring six factors:

* Intrinsic Goal Orientation
* Task Value
* Test Anxiety
* Extrinsic Goal Orientation
* Control of Learning Beliefs
* Self-Efficacy
